# Github/git Assignment

Learning to use a version control system is an essential task for every Computer Scientist.  ```git``` is a very widely used version control system made by the creator of Linux.  ```git``` allows us to save changes to our code, keep different versions, try out features and choose whether or not to adopt them, etc.

Teaching ```git``` is beyond the scope of this class, but I strongly encourage you to use it and to submit your projects this way.

Github offers free hosting for student repositories.  Many employers may ask to see your Github during the hiring process, as it serves as a portfolio of sorts for your code.  Additionally, ```git``` and Github makes it trivial to work as a team on a single software project.

## Tutorial

As mentioned I will not be teaching ```git``` directly in this class.  However, to ensure that everyone has at least enough exposure to clone code samples, assignment files, etc. I wish you to do the following:

  - Complete the tutorial [https://try.github.io/](https://try.github.io "Github tutorial")
  - Setup a Github account and create a repository called 343-HW1.
  - Put two files in this repository, a ```README.md``` that includes a few sentences about which commands ```git``` provides that you will commonly use, and an image (```.jpg```, ```.png```, etc.) that shows you completing the git tutorial.

## Thoughts...

Learning to use ```git``` will aid your software development greatly.  Yes, this is a simple assignment, but put in the time and try to understand what you are learning.

Have questions?  Ask them on Slack (and answer them!).  We are learning as a community.  Don't just give answers though; provide insight and direction.  

## Submission

Github repositories all have a green "Clone or download" button.  Click this button, copy the clone URL and paste it in Blackboard by September 5 at 8:00 a.m.
