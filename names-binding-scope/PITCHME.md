Names, Binding, and scope
(Follows the Sebesta Text Chapter 5)
---
**Overview**
***

At their heart, imperative languages are abstractions of the hardware.

Variables, for instance, are merely representations of memory locations.

Sometimes the representations are very similar to what is in the hardware; other times software provides some translation.
---
**Overview**
***

Programming languages assign names to variables and functions.

As simple as it may seem to us, when designing a language there are complex issues involved with choosing a naming scheme.
---
**Names**
***

A name is not required for a member; they really just exist for our benefit.  Computers are perfectly happy just using addresses.

Some issues with names are the characters allowed to be used for the name, case sensitivity, the number of characters the name is made up of, are reserved words usable and if any "decorators" are used.
---
**Names**
***

There are vastly different rules for naming depending on the language.  For instance:

- Fortran allows only up to 31 characters
- C has no limit, but only the first 63 are significant (most compilers ignore this and have no limit these days).
- Java, C#, and Ada have no limit and all are significant
- C++ provides no limit, though certain implementations do.
---
**Names**
***

So we need to be very careful when using a language; this could create a problem then:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  int aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa = 42;
  int aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab = 24;

  printf("%d\n", aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa);
  printf("%d\n", aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab);
}
```

Though most (newer) implementations seem to handle this just fine.
---
**Names**
***

Some of these issues may seem trivial, but we need to remember that these rules are going to either help or hinder areas such as readability and writability.

For instance, Java's insistence on case sensitivity allows us to have the following:

```Java
student1.toString()
student1.ToString()
student1.tostring()
student1.TOSTRING()
student1.tOsTrInG()
etc...
```
---
**Names**
***

As all of those permutations *could* be valid, it is both harder to tell what the original programmer's intent was (readability), and harder to keep track of all the possible functions we may wish to call (writability).
---
**Names**
***

Many languages reserve certain words and do not allow us to use them as variable names.  These are called **reserved words**.

Other languages may have **keywords**.  These may be context sensitive.  For instance, in Fortran the word **Integer** is a keyword.  It can be used to denote a variable type, or it can be used as a variable:
---
```Fortran
Integer Num_cars
Integer = 42
```

Note that context matters here; the first example was the keyword before a variable name; it is then a type specifier.  In the second example the keyword is followed by an assignment operator meaning it is to be interpreted as a variable.
---
**Variables**
***

Variables can be seen as a collection of six attributes:

- name
- address
- value
- type
- lifetime
- scope
---
**Address**
***

We already discussed names so we'll next examine address.

As you can probably guess, the address is the machine address where the variable's value is stored.
---
**Address**
***

We call the address of a variable its **l-value**.  This is due to the fact that in most languages assignment statements put name on the left side.

A single address may be referred to by multiple variables.  When this happens we say that a variable has an **alias**.
---
```C++
// An alias in C++ created by using
// a reference.
int y = 42;
int & x = y;

std::cout << x << std::endl;
std::cout << y << std::endl;

y = 1701;
std::cout << x << std::endl;

42
42
1701
```
---
**Address**
***

Notice that changing y changed x as well.

Aliases are a huge hit on readability, as they make programs much harder for a reader to understand.  They also make it vastly harder to debug a program, meaning they hurt writability as well.
---
**Type**
***

Types determine both the range of values a variable can hold, and the operations that may be performed.

We must be careful to fully understand the compiler(s) and machine(s) we are using when writing a program when it comes to type.  For instance:
---
**Type**
***

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
        printf("Type\t\t\tBytes\t\tMin Value\t\tMax Value\n");
        printf("---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n");
        printf("unsigned char\t\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t\t%d\n", sizeof(unsigned char), 0, UCHAR_MAX);
        printf("char\t\t\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t\t%d\n", sizeof(char), CHAR_MIN, CHAR_MAX);
        printf("unsigned int\t\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t\t%u\n", sizeof(unsigned int), 0, UINT_MAX);
        printf("int\t\t\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t%d\n", sizeof(int), INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
        printf("unsigned long\t\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t\t%lu\n", sizeof(unsigned long), 0, ULONG_MAX);
        printf("long\t\t\t%ld\t\t%ld\t%ld\n", sizeof(long), LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX);
        printf("unsigned long long\t%lu\t\t%d\t\t\t%llu\n", sizeof(unsigned long long), 0, ULLONG_MAX);
        printf("long long\t\t%lu\t\t%lld\t%lld\n", sizeof(long long), LLONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX);
        printf("float\t\t\t%lu\t\t%e\t\t%e\n", sizeof(float), -FLT_MAX, FLT_MAX);
        printf("double\t\t\t%lu\t\t%e\t\t%e\n", sizeof(double), -DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX);
        printf("long double\t\t%lu\t\t%Le\t\t%Le\n", sizeof(long double), -LDBL_MAX, LDBL_MAX);
}
```
---
**Type**
***

On a 64-bit Intel system I get the following output:

```

Yet, on a 32-bit ARM I get this:

```

```
---
**Types**
***

A few differences exist for the two.  Many people will notice that the long double doesn't hold as high a value.  In fact, a long double on the second system is the same as a double on the first.

What you may have missed though is the fact that on the ARM system a char and unsigned char produced the same values.
---
**Types**
***

It turns out that on ARM based systems chars default to unsigned.  This could have some fairly significant effects on our code.  For instance, it is not uncommon that programmers return -1 from a function when it is unable to complete a task.  Consider:
---
```C
#include <stdio.h>

char doSomething(int successful){
        if(successful>0){
                return 'a';
        }
        return -1;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv){
        char result = doSomething(1);
        printf("%d\n", result);
        result = doSomething(-1);
        printf("%d\n", result);
}
```
---
**Types**
***

Running this on the two systems we get the output

```C
97
-1
```

On the Intel system And

```C
97
255
```

On the ARM.
---
**Value**
***

What we store in the memory locations the variable is comprised of is the value.

We call the value the **r-value** as it is usually on the right side of an assignment statement.
---
**Value**
***

Although it seems fairly straightforward, determining the value for an r-value can be complicated due to scoping rules.
---
An understanding of scope and lifetime requires us to first talk about binding.

As the book does, we will pause talking about variable attributes here and focus on binding.
---
**Binding**
***

A binding occurs when we associate an attribute and an entity.

This does not refer strictly to a variable; we can associate a function with an attribute as well.
---
Binding can occur at

- **language design time** (think of an operator)
- **language implementation time** (imagine a data type in C; it must be implemented on multiple hardwares so will have different ranges)
- **compile time** (imagine associating a variable with a type)
- **load time** (an address is given to a variable when the program is loaded into memory)
- **link time** (associating a function with an address in library)
- **run time** (giving a variable a value)
---
**Binding**
***

A **static** binding occurs *before runtime* and does not change while the program is running.

A binding that occurs during runtime and can change *while the program is running* is **dynamic**.
---
Consider this code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
        static int meaning;
		meaning = 42;
        int runtimeStuff = 1701;
        printf("The meaning is %d.\n\n", meaning);
}
```
---
While the value ```42``` is not assigned statically, we can tell that the address itself is being bound at compile time by running ```objdump -t``` on the executable:
---
```C
... // Lots of output...

0000000000601034 l     O .data	0000000000000004              main.meaning

... // Lots more output...
```
---
In the midst of all the output we find the variable ```main.meaning``` is given a memory location, even before the program is run.  By contrast, notice that there is no address defined for runtimeStuff.  This will be determined when the program is run.
---
**Binding**
***

Type bindings may be **implicit** or **explicit**.  Explicit type bindings may harm writability but aid readability.

Implicit type bindings do the opposite.  In addition, they can harm reliability as they remove the ability of a compiler to detect errors before runtime.
---
**Binding**
***

Please note that implicit/explicit bindings are a separate topic from static/dynamic bindings, though I've found that students' tend to confuse the two.  

This is likely due to the fact that many dynamic languages use implicit type systems (Python, etc.) though there are those that are static and implicit (Go).
---
**Binding**
***

For a binding to occur, we first need to go through the process of **Allocation**, which refers to assigning a variable an address from a pool of memory.

**Deallocation** is the returning of the memory to the pool.
---
**Binding**
***

The **lifetime** of a variable is the time during which it is bound to a particular memory location.
---
**Binding**
***

**Static variables** are bound to memory cells before programs are executed, and stay bound until the program ends.

>> Note that this is different from the last example,
>> in that here we are assigning a value BEFORE runtime
>> and previously we were just creating the memory.
>> We'll call this file static.c

---
Viewing the file we can verify this binding:
```C
gcc static.c
objdump -t a.out
...
0000000000601030 l     O .data  0000000000000004              num_threads.1833
...

objdump -x a.out

...
Contents of section .data:
 601020 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000  ................
 601030 2a000000
...
```

For those of you wondering, ```2a``` in hex is ```42``` in decimal.  
---
**Binding**
***

Static variables are very fast, as compilers typically substitute the address for the variable, allowing for direct access (no lookup).

Additionally, there is no overhead for allocating a static variable; it is given a memory location at compile time.
---
**Binding**
***

**Elaboration** is the process that happens at run-time of allocating and binding a variable.  There are a few different elaboration methods we will be talking about.
---
**Binding**
***


**Stack-dynamic** variables are variables that are statically bound but created when they are elaborated.
---
An example of these is local variables in C.  Each function will have local variables; the space for them is not created until the function's memory is created.  When the program executes (elaborates) the code for the variable, it is created.
---
They are useful because they allow recursion (a subprogram must have dynamic local storage for recursion).

The disadvantage is run-time overhead, as allocating and deallocating variables can be high, and they are not history sensitive (meaning when you call another instance of a function the variable does not keep the value of the variable from the first call).
---
Why can't we have recursion without these variables?

Consider this language that only has global storage:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int n;

int factorial() {
  if (n == 0) return 1;           // Base case
  n = n - 1;
  return (n * Factorial());
}

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  n = atoi(argv[1]);
  printf("Factorial of %d is %d.\n", n, factorial());
}
```
---
**Binding**
***

**Explicit Heap-Dynamic Variables** are allocated and deallocated at run-time by the programmer.

They are useful because they can be used for dynamically sized structures, but they are difficult for programmers to use correctly.
---
```C
int* nums;
nums = (int*) malloc(50 * sizeof(int));

...

// Must give memory back at some point.
free(nums);
```
---
**Binding**
***

**Implicit Heap-Dynamic Variables** are bound to heap storage only when they are assigned a value.

These are very flexible, but run-time overhead is high, and they don't have the ability to be error checked by the compiler.

We tend to see these in interpreted languages.  Consider this Javascript code for example (from the book):

```Javascript
highs = [74, 84, 86, 90, 71];
```
---
**Scope**
***

**Scope** is the range of statements for which a variable is visible (visible meaning it can be referenced).

A variable is **local** to the scope in which it was declared.
---
**Scope**
***

**Static scope** means that the variable's scope can be determined before execution of the program.

Helps readability.
---
**Scope**
***

When resolving variables the system starts with the declarations in the current subprogram.  If it is not found there, it continues out to the **static parent** (the outer enclosing unit).  

This continues up through other **static ancestors** until the variable can be resolved (or we run out of places to look).
---
**Scope**
***

ALGOL 60 brought the oft copied idea of **blocks**, or **block structured languages**.

These languages allow new scopes to be defined within executable code.  For instance:
---
```C
int main(int argc, char** argv){
  int i=0;
  while(i<100){
    // We are in another scope here!
    int square = i * i;
  }
}
```
---
**Scope**
***

**Global variables** exist outside of function definitions, but are resolvable from within functions.

In some languages we must be careful to not re-use a name of a global within some local scope.  For instance, in C we could do this:

```C
int num_threads;

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  // Now the int is un-resolvable!
  float num_threads = 3.14;
}
```
---
**Scope**
***

Languages with robust namespace capabilities may allow us to access the globals anyway.  For instance, C++ allows us to do this:

```C++
#include <iostream>

int num_threads = 0;

int main(int argc, char** argv){
        float num_threads = 3.14;
        std::cout << num_threads << std::endl;
        std::cout << ::num_threads << std::endl;
}
```
---
**Scope**
***

There are other methods as well.  PHP uses a $GLOBALS array.  We can access those globals in two ways:

```PHP
$num_threads = 200;

function get_threads() {
  global $num_threads;
  print "Num threads = $num_threads.";
}
```
---
Or:

```PHP
$num_threads = 200;

function get_threads() {
  $nt = $GLOBALS['num_threads'];
  print "Num threads = $nt.";
}
```
---
**Scope**
***

Python (as is often the case...) has its own rules.  In Python a global can be referenced but not assigned to in a function, unless it is declared global at the beginning.  Thus, this will not work (from the book):

```Python
day = "Monday"

def tester():
  print "The global day is:", day
  day = "Tuesday"
  print "The new value of day is:", day

tester()
```
---
**Scope**
***

However, this will (we can access):

```Python
day = "Monday"
def tester():
  print "The global day is:", day
tester()
```
---
**Scope**
***

And this will (we declare the variable global first [now we can modify!]):

```Python
day = "Monday"

def tester():
  global day
  print "The global day is:", day
  day = "Tuesday"
  print "The new value of day is:", day

tester()
```
---
**Scope**
***

Static scope does have issues:

  - Usually allows more access than needed.
  - Restricts program evolution - leading programmers to do things they shouldn't.
    - They may make more things global (Ugh!)
    - May end up with an awkward designing

These issues are largely fixed by encapsulation.
---
**Scope**
***

**Dynamic Scope** resolves variables not by the blocks they are in, but by the calling sequence of the program.

It is largely unseen in newer languages (but still available in some cases).

Dynamic Scope destroys readability.

Consider:
---
```
function big()
{
  function sub1() {
    var x = 7;
  }

  function sub2() {
    var y = x;
    var z = 3;
  }

  var x = 3;
}
```

Imagine that this is written in a language that resolves scope dynamically.  If later in the program we call big.sub1(), then big.sub2(), the value of y in sub2() will be 7.  If though, we merely called big.sub2(), the value for y would be 3.
---
**Scope**
***

Dynamic scope destroys readability completely.  We cannot look at a program and tell what the value of all variables are at any given time (we don't know what the calling sequence would be; any input could change the calling sequence).

Because dynamically scoped languages cannot resolve variable information statically debugging becomes a nightmare.
---
**Lifetime**
***

Don't confuse scope and **lifetime**.  They may appear related but aren't; scope is more of a textual relationship (or spatial), whereas lifetime deals with time.

Consider:
---
```C
void do_stuff(){
        static int meaning = 42;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv){
        do_stuff();
}
```

The variable ```meaning``` is local in scope, but because it is static exists throughout the life of the program.  Want proof?
---

Compile it, and run ```objdump -t a.out```

```
...
000000000060102c l     O .data  0000000000000004              do_stuff.meaning
...
```

This shows that the variable is statically bound, but local in scope!  It will exist until the program ends, but is only accessible inside the ```do_stuff()``` function.
---
**Scope**
***

**Named Constants** are variables that are named only once.  They enhance readability.

Consider:

```C
const int MEANING = 42;

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  MEANING = 43;
}

clang st.c
st.c:3:10: error: read-only variable is not assignable
        MEANING = 43;
        ~~~~~~~ ^
1 error generated.
```
---
Additionally, if we didn't try to reassign to the constant, we can view the objdump:

```
...
00000000004005a0 g     O .rodata        0000000000000004              MEANING
...
```

Or:

```
...

...
```
